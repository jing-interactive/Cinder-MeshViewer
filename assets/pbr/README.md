Usage
-----

**Controls**

`click + drag` : Rotate model

`scroll` : Zoom camera

`GUI` : Use to change models and settings

**Change glTF model**

* Choose one of the glTF models in the selection list

or

* Drag and drop glTF files into viewer

Setup
-----

For local usage and debugging, please follow these instructions:

**(0)** Make sure [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com) is installed.

**(1)** Checkout the [`master`](../../tree/master) branch

**(2)** Install dependencies with `npm install`

**(3)** Pull the submodules for the required [glTF sample models](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models) and [environments](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Environments) `git submodule update  --init --recursive`

**(4a)** Start a demo in the browser with `npm run dev`, and open http://localhost:8000.

**(4b)** Start a demo in Electron with `npm run dev:electron`.

When making changes, the project is automatically rebuilt and the `dist/` folder
is updated. Files in the `dist/` folder should not be included in pull
requests — they will be updated by project maintainers with each new release.

Offline / Headless Rendering
----------------------------

**NOTE:** The dimensions of the rendered image are limited by the (virtual) desktop size.

Requirements
  * [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
  * [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) (Installed automatically)

Configure environment
- ``npm install`` (also installs Electron)
- ``npm run build`` (“compile” the code)

Run
- ``npm run start-offscreen -- -- -h`` for a list of available options

Example
- ``npm run start-offscreen -- -- assets/models/2.0/FlightHelmet/glTF/FlightHelmet.gltf``

After execution, the screenshot is stored as ``output.png`` on the file system.

Debugging
---------

* Requirements
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  * [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
* Install the [Debugger for Firefox](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-firefox-debug) extension for Visual Studio Code
* Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code and select `Debug->Add Configuration->Firefox` so the `.vscode/launch.json` file is created.
* `Debug->Start Debugging` should now launch a Firefox window with the sample viewer and VS Code breakpoints should be hit.


Physically-Based Materials in glTF 2.0
======================================

With the change from glTF 1.0 to glTF 2.0, one of the largest changes included core support for materials that could be used for physically-based shading. Part of this process involved choosing technically accurate, yet user-friendly, parameters for which developers and artists could use intuitively. This resulted in the introduction of the **Metallic-Roughness Material** to glTF. If you would like to read more about glTF, you can find the content at its [GitHub page](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF).

A good reference about Physically-Based Materials and its workflow can be found on the [THE PBR GUIDE - PART 1](https://academy.allegorithmic.com/courses/the-pbr-guide-part-1) and [THE PBR GUIDE - PART 2](https://academy.allegorithmic.com/courses/the-pbr-guide-part-2) from [allegorithmic](https://www.allegorithmic.com).

For implementation details and further theory, please find more information in the [Real Shading in Unreal Engine 4](https://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/) presentation from the SIGGRAPH 2013 course.


Appendix A: Metallic-Roughness Material
=======================================

For further reference, please read the [glTF 2.0: Appendix B: BRDF Implementation](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/specification/2.0/README.md#appendix-b-brdf-implementation)
The following sections do summarize the important shader code.

```glsl
vec3 F_specular = D * Vis * F;
vec3 F_diffuse = (1.0 - F) * diffuse;
vec3 F = F_specular + F_diffuse;
```

Please note: Vis = G / (4 * NdotL * NdotV)

## Specular Term (F_specular)

**Microfacet metallic-roughness BRDF**

```glsl
vec3 metallicBRDF (vec3 f0, vec3 f90, float alphaRoughness, float VdotH, float NdotL, float NdotV, float NdotH)
{
    vec3 F = fresnel(f0, f90, VdotH);
    float Vis = V_GGX(NdotL, NdotV, alphaRoughness);
    float D = D_GGX(NdotH, alphaRoughness);

    return F * Vis * D;
}
```

### Surface Reflection Ratio (F)

**Fresnel Schlick**

```glsl
vec3 fresnel(vec3 f0, vec3 f90, float VdotH)
{
    return f0 + (f90 - f0) * pow(clamp(1.0 - VdotH, 0.0, 1.0), 5.0);
}
```

Please note, that the above shader code includes the optimization for "turning off" the Fresnel edge brightening (see "Real-Time Rendering" Fourth Edition on page 325).

### Geometric Occlusion / Visibility (V)

**Smith Joint GGX**

```glsl
float V_GGX(float NdotL, float NdotV, float alphaRoughness)
{
    float alphaRoughnessSq = alphaRoughness * alphaRoughness;

    float GGXV = NdotL * sqrt(NdotV * NdotV * (1.0 - alphaRoughnessSq) + alphaRoughnessSq);
    float GGXL = NdotV * sqrt(NdotL * NdotL * (1.0 - alphaRoughnessSq) + alphaRoughnessSq);

    float GGX = GGXV + GGXL;
    if (GGX > 0.0)
    {
        return 0.5 / GGX;
    }
    return 0.0;
}
```

### Normal Distribution (D)

**Trowbridge-Reitz GGX**

```glsl
float D_GGX(float NdotH, float alphaRoughness)
{
    float alphaRoughnessSq = alphaRoughness * alphaRoughness;
    float f = (NdotH * NdotH) * (alphaRoughnessSq - 1.0) + 1.0;
    return alphaRoughnessSq / (M_PI * f * f);
}
```

## Diffuse Term (F_diffuse)

**Lambertian**

```glsl
vec3 lambertian(vec3 f0, vec3 f90, vec3 diffuseColor, float VdotH)
{
    return (1.0 - fresnel(f0, f90, VdotH)) * (diffuseColor / M_PI);
}
```

Appendix B: FAQ
===============

Q: Why do I not see environment lighting here [https://github.khronos.org/glTF-Sample-Viewer/](https://github.khronos.org/glTF-Sample-Viewer/)?  
A: The glTF Sample Viewer is using [KTX2](http://github.khronos.org/KTX-Specification/) for the pre-filtered environments. However, the mime type is not yet registered [here](https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db).
